A full content engine means treating every medium—video, shorts, podcasts, ads, vlogs, voiceovers, scripts, storyboards, thumbnails, captions, and repurposed derivatives—as nodes in one unified production graph. The architecture shifts from “book-to-script” to a media‑agnostic creation pipeline that ingests anything and outputs everything.

Below is the rebuilt blueprint for OmniCreator Studio: The Universal Content Engine.

---

🧩 Core pillars of the Universal Content Engine

Content Ingest Layer
Accepts any raw material:
- Raw video
- Audio/podcast episodes
- Long-form scripts
- Short-form ideas
- Commercial briefs
- Vlog footage
- Social posts
- Meeting recordings
- Voice notes

Each input becomes a Content Object with metadata:
- type (video, audio, text, mixed)
- duration
- topics
- speakers
- visual anchors
- sentiment
- quality metrics

This is the foundation for all downstream tools.

🎛️ Modular Creation Labs

Script Lab
Transforms any input into structured scripts:
- Short-form hooks (5–15 seconds)
- Shorts/Reels/TikTok scripts (15–60 seconds)
- Long-form video scripts (3–20 minutes)
- Podcast outlines
- Commercial scripts
- Vlog narration
- Voiceover scripts
- Educational explainers

Includes:
- Tone presets (cinematic, comedic, authoritative, conversational)
- Platform presets (TikTok, YouTube, IG, LinkedIn, podcast)
- Multi-version generation (A/B/C variants)

---

Visual Story Lab
Turns scripts or videos into visual plans:
- Scene breakdowns
- B‑roll suggestions
- Shot lists
- Camera movement suggestions
- Lighting/mood boards
- Thumbnail prompt ideas
- On-screen text suggestions

This is the “Director’s Assistant” for all creators.

---

Audio Lab
Handles all voice and sound needs:
- Voice cloning
- Voiceover generation
- Podcast cleanup
- Noise reduction
- Music bed suggestions
- Emotional delivery control
- Multi-speaker synthesis

---

Avatar & Presenter Lab
For creators who don’t want to be on camera:
- Talking head avatars
- Character presenters
- Brand mascots
- Lip-sync alignment
- Style presets (realistic, stylized, animated)

---

Video Assembly Lab
A simplified timeline editor:
- Multi-track editing
- Auto-resize for 16:9, 9:16, 1:1
- Auto-captioning
- Auto-b-roll insertion
- Auto-zoom/pan for emphasis
- Template-based intros/outros
- Brand kits (colors, fonts, overlays)

---

Repurposing Lab
The highest-leverage module:
- Long video → 10 shorts
- Podcast → clips + quotes + blog + newsletter
- Commercial → multiple ad variants
- Vlog → highlight reels
- Webinar → course modules
- Meeting → action items + summaries + clips

This is where creators multiply output without multiplying effort.

🏗️ System Architecture (Media-Agnostic)

Experience Layer (Frontend)
- Next.js or SvelteKit
- Glassmorphic UI with large, clear controls
- Drag-and-drop ingest
- Studio-style workspace
- Guided workflows for non-technical users

---

Orchestration Layer (Backend)
A Node/NestJS service that:
- Normalizes all inputs into Content Objects
- Routes tasks to the correct AI engines
- Manages job queues for heavy tasks
- Handles provider failover (Claude/GPT/Gemini)
- Stores project states and autosaves
- Manages OAuth for social platforms

---

AI Engine Layer
A set of interchangeable adapters:
- LLMProvider (Claude, GPT, Gemini)
- VoiceProvider (ElevenLabs)
- AvatarProvider (D-ID, Synthesia)
- VisionProvider (OpenAI Vision, Gemini Vision)
- AudioProvider (Whisper, Adobe Speech Enhance)
- RenderProvider (FFmpeg workers or cloud renderers)

Each provider implements a shared interface so you can swap vendors without rewriting features.

---

Data Layer
- Postgres for structured data
- S3-compatible storage for media
- Redis for job queues and caching
- CDN for fast asset delivery

Entities:
- Project
- ContentObject
- ScriptDraft
- StoryboardScene
- MediaAsset
- Timeline
- RepurposedAsset
- ScheduledPost

---

Distribution Layer
Handles publishing and scheduling:
- YouTube API
- TikTok API
- Instagram Graph API
- Podcast RSS automation
- LinkedIn posting
- Facebook Pages
- Twitter/X

Includes:
- Content calendar
- Multi-platform scheduling
- Auto-formatting per platform
- Performance tracking

---

🔐 Security & Trust Layer
Critical for older or non-technical users:
- Backend proxy for all AI calls
- No API keys exposed to the client
- Role-based access
- Audit logs
- Version history
- Autosave every 30 seconds
- Recovery snapshots

---

🧠 Unified Content Graph (the secret weapon)
Every piece of content is a node in a graph:
- A long-form video links to its clips
- Clips link to their scripts
- Scripts link to their storyboards
- Storyboards link to their assets
- Assets link to their render jobs
- Render jobs link to their scheduled posts

This makes the system:
- Traceable
- Repurposable
- Extensible
- AI-friendly

---

🚀 What this architecture unlocks
- One input → dozens of outputs  
- One script → multiple formats  
- One video → shorts, ads, thumbnails, captions, quotes  
- One podcast → clips, blog posts, newsletters, social posts  
- One commercial → multiple ad variants  

It becomes a true content engine, not a single-purpose tool.

If you want, I can now generate:
- A full folder structure for the entire system  
- API contracts for each module  
- A data model diagram  
- A feature roadmap for v1 → v2 → v3  
- A brand identity system for OmniCreator Studio  

Which direction do you want to lock in next?
