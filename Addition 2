give me a integration outline for each

Postiz-app integrates via REST API for seamless scheduling in your synth-like engine, while InstaPy offers Python lib calls for IG-specific posting.[1][2] These outlines chain with Open-Sora/YuE outputs, using Docker for modularity per your auto-discovery prefs.[3]

## Postiz-app Outline
Self-host with Docker Compose (PostgreSQL/Temporal), generate API key from settings.[1]
Chain generation: Run YuE/Open-Sora → save MP4 → use wizard for JSON payload (e.g., {"content": "caption", "attachments": ["video.mp4"]}) → POST /public/v1/posts with Authorization: Bearer <key>.[1][4]
Modular: Wrap in Node.js/TS service (axios fetch), expose as Cheetah module; cron or Workers for auto-post at optimal times.[5][6]

## ImPosting Outline
Docker up Django app, configure OAuth for IG pro/X (ngrok callbacks), migrate DB.
Pipeline: Content gen → upload via /api/upload (multipart form) → POST /api/schedule with {"post_data": {...}, "scheduled_at": "2026-02-04T10:00:00Z"}.
Extend: Python/TS client hits endpoints; integrate folder watcher for auto-queue like your science tools.

## InstaPy Outline
Pip install instapy/selenium, chromedriver Docker.[2]
Script: from instapy import InstaPy; session = InstaPy(...); session.login(); session.upload_video("gen_video.mp4", "AI music reel #ncsound").[2]
Engine fit: Embed as subprocess in FastAPI backend, throttle sleeps; chain post-gen with set_comments from LLM.[7]

[5] Based on your description, it sounds like you're looking to build a custom content creation and management tool—essentially a unified dashboard that integrates multiple APIs for generating content (e.g., from AI services like OpenAI or Google Cloud) ...

...atforms change APIs frequently (e.g., Twitter's recent shifts to paid tiers). Budget for premium access if needed (e.g., $100/month for Twitter API).
   - **Costs**: Free tiers exist, but heavy use could rack up fees (e.g., OpenAI charges per token). https://www.perplexity.ai/search/181ce5e0-6e98-4afe-9fb8-8dea03f41c97
